            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>After decades in professional audio—corporate events, touring, broadcast—we kept running into the same problems. Scattered documentation. Lost channel sheets. Crew members without access to critical information. Power calculations on napkins.</p>
            
            <p>Every show, we'd rebuild the same spreadsheets. Every gig, we'd hunt for last week's RF coordination. Every load-in, someone would ask "what's the COMM situation?" and we'd dig through emails.</p>
            
            <p>ShowStack is our solution. A single platform purpose-built for live audio professionals. Everything you need for show prep, documentation, and crew coordination—accessible from any device, shareable with your entire team.</p>
            
            <p>We're not a generic project management tool trying to fit audio into a box. We built ShowStack specifically for the way audio engineers actually work.</p>
